            Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of
            websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing,
            web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an
            application that works over the internet i.e. websites. Web
            development is typically broken down into 3 core areas: Frontend,
            Backend, Full Stack Development.

            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard
            markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure
            of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements
            tell the browser how to display the content.

          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to style
            web pages, while CSS3 is its advanced version with new features and
            modules. CSS3 introduces enhanced styling capabilities like
            animations, transitions, media queries, and rounded corners,
            providing more flexibility and functionality for web design.

          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
            implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
            more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
            animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of
            the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and
            CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the
            Learning Area.
